# U1.W2: Design, User Experience, and creating your website Reflection

My Website url: http://benbrostoff.github.io/mywireframe.html

Discuss the following:

* What did you learn about design and user experience? 

The user experience is largely dictated by (i) the device / medium they're using (laptop, monitor, tablet, phone) and (ii) the browser they're using. Responsive design is important in this respect. I am trying to make a concerted effort to use ems and %'s more often, but I know that's only a first step.

Design should be necessarily simple as well. The user needs to be able to easily navigate and hop around. As a result, I've tried to keep the header and footer in place where I can. I think it is somewhat annoying when sites open up a new tab, as then you end up with a bunch of tabs.

* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)

I think design and user experience are important, but I'm not sure how much I like working on it. Pre-week 1, I really liked doing the Ruby exercises as I think those are extremely intellectual and challenging and force you to think about CS concepts as opposed to just refreshing the HTML every 8 seconds to gauge for changes. I do not feel like I am learning as much now as I did initially when Ruby was all new to me. CSS / HTML in general feels a bit like guess and check and reguess and recheck. I like the interactivity and flexibility of Ruby more (I realize we need to cover this bit, just making the point). Other than create visually stunning sites and enhancing user experience, CSS / HTML does not feel as "important" or able to do so much (maybe that's where we are going with Javascript next week).

* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?

I was really frustrated using percentages at first as opposed to pixels. For instance, I wanted my mission statement to be smaller than the nav bar but symmetrically positioned with equal length on both sides. I had to fumble around before I realized the left margin should be (1 - (width of body as percentage of overall width))/2. 

Also, I still need to perfect how to get the footer so it's always X distance below the closest object. This became difficult when I had a bunch of in-line elements.

* What would you like to add or change about the site next?

I think I'd like to buid in a blog that looks standard and clean (Interest date blocks, pull quotes, etc.). I have a blog linked there that goes to some essays I've written, but this blog would largely be computer-science and Ruby-based in nature (another means to reinforce concepts we are learnign at DBC).

* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?

Admittedly, I did not use all the concepts we learned this week. As previously noted, I did try to put a specific focus on using ems and percentages. It was cool when I figured out how to make the body smaller width-wise and symmetrically positioned undernet the nav bar (see "what was your process...").

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

A bit of Stack Overflow, as per usual.
