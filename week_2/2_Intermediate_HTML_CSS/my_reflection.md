# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?

I'm a believer in the adage that discipline begets creativity, and in this respect I think web standards are good. They give people a standard framework to work with and no one is obligated to follow them to the letter (to be honest, I'm not sure I know exactly what 'web standards' mean but presumably this refers to things like the structure / styles proposed by reset.css and the HTML 5 framework. All web pages clearly do not look the same, so standards do not appear to be dampening creativity. 

* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?

It does. The standard structure has many structural elements that commonly appear in websites. 

* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?

I used both the header and nav elements in the redesign of my github page. The defaults make sense and from an appearance perspective look note. 

* Why is reset.css necessary? 

Reset.css is necessary because browsers are fundamentally different and web designers do not want different browsers to display different pages. The reset.css (generally with some alterations) leads to consistency in appearance for websites across browsers. As noted in cssreset.com, reset.css sets a browser's default assumptions to null and thereby eliminates differing assumptions across browsers.

* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?

I use Chrome at home, and when I was at Wells Fargo, I had to use Microsoft Internet Explorer. There were a number of scenarios wherein Chrome showed a certain element and Microsoft Internet Explorer appeared to bungle it. It's probably good that browsers have to "catch up" to web design. It promotes competition and encourages more advanced browsers with more functionality. Web design has certainly improved over the last 20 years, and I would think this is somewhat related to advances in browsers.

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

CSSreset.com was good for explaining the importance of CSS reset files.
