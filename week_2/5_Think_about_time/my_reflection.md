# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 

My biggest time management challenge was my current job at Wells Fargo. Fortunately, I gave my two weeks notice two weeks ago and my last day was this Friday. I think now my challenge becomes approaching each day as I would were I at work (making to do lists, updating my Workflowy, figuring out which clients need attention, reading documents, making models, etc.). I am more self-directed now and there are fewer tasks that "need to be done". However, considering how much ground I have to make up on experienced programmers, I think it's imperative I take advantage of being unemployed now and start to go at programming 8+ hours a day (or whatver amount of time someone at a large software company would go and more).

Right now there is a temptation to take my foot off the gas pedal because I just finished up a difficult job I had done for two years. If anything, I have to use my free time to work harder than I've ever worked before, and this time it will be about something I feel passionate about.

This theme has been hit to death by Malcolm Gladwell et. al, but I know I'm behind on my 10,000 hours and better start accumulating them as quickly as possible. 

* How will you combat that? 

Again, I'm combating the lack of structure and coordinated activities that comes with having a lot of free time. I think the way to combat this issue is to make structure and coordination. I need to write what I am going to do and how I am going to do it each morning and execute. I need to be keeping a running track record of what I learn and the questions I have so I can follow up with the DBC instructors during office hours. There are already things I know I need to drill myself better in: the command line / terminal, how to use Sublime Text more effectively, getting comfortable with Github and commits and cloning things to the desktop and forks, etc.

In part the reason I quit when I did is because I wanted some time on my own to get ready for the DBC classroom stage. I could have stayed right up until June and kept getting dem checks (in the words of Jalen Rose), but it would have been a disservice to my learning and ability to get the most out of DBC (in my honest opinion). 

* What techniques will you try?

I'm going to try a Bill Belichick / Coach K type method of just planning everything out to the utmost detail. I'll even map out stuff I have to do in my personal life (taxes being the big one of late). Perhaps some of you can relate, but I feel the clock ticking each day to judgment day when we graduate from DBC. I personally want to come in and kick ass for those first programming interviews, and even if I fail, I want to know that all the way back in April I was doing late nights programming and practicing and getting better.

It sometimes helps to have a team / support group for this kind of thing, so if anyone wants to link up and discuss best practices for each week, let me know. I'd be more than happy to pair on stuff and talk about good books and resources for learning. 

* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?

I want to focus on process more than anything else. Now that I'm done at Wells Fargo, I want to be programming 8+ hours a day. I know this is a difficult self-directed task, but more difficult self-directed things have been done. I want Phase 0 to be as intense as possible so I'm more than ready for the classroom work.
