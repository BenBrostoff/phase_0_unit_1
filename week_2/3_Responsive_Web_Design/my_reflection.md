# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?

Responsive web design is design that dynamically adjusts for the size of the browser window a web page is being viewed in. Generally, the code is percentage and relative based as opposed to absolute (pixel based). Responsive web design in my opinion is a must in today's internet consumption era wherein people view websites on mobile, tablets, etc. A website that is otherwise beautiful on a standard PC could look terrible on a mobile phone. It is a must that your product be available on multiple mediums, so I certainly understand that learning responsive web design is a must. 


* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?

In general, smart phones and tablets are built such that length is much larger than width (rectangular). Computer screens are squares. I would be willing to venture a lot of web designers when they start wireframing are now thinking more about rectangles than squares, or at least thinking about CSS3 Media Queries that respond from the square to rectangle change. To the extent that new technology changes the shape of how we view media, designers will have to develop more dynamic responsiveness. However, from my perspective, humans are most comfortable reading things in rectangles and squares, and I am unable to envision how a new medium could call for more responsiveness.


* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?

I think in our multi-touch / 3D printing era, it would be fascinating if you could develop a machine that could produce braille based on HTML / CSS. However, that is a topic where I am totally out of my element and cannot speak to.

For those who are not blind but need large font to read, I think developers should make sites that cater to them. It does seem like there are some options on your browser / phone to enlarge text already. To the extent developers can be helpful here, they should (is the problem already solved). 

* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?

I think ems and percentages over pixels makes complete sense to me, and I am unlikely to use pixels again. CSS3 Media Queries seem extremely difficult and I'm a bit unprepared regarding how to think about them correctly. What constitutes the right moment to totally change the layout on your page? Is it when X=Y or when X=Z?


* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I ended up using the first two resources listed after I could only make it through the first section of Treehouse before I was asked to purchase a subscription. I am wondering if others think the $25 a month is worth it.
